## Introduction

I was born in Brasil.
I moved to USA years ago where I have been living since then.
 I am Educational Assistant at High School. 

I have B.S. in Genetics from University California Davis
After that I continued towards my Master in Science in Cell and Molecular Biology at San Francisco State 
University.

I am interested in how “ourselves”  our personality arises from living tissue. 
Whena group of neurons start to have characteristics of cognition?
When a neural activity starts to produce coherent activiyt that it is perceived as cognition ?
When a group of neurons start to "think"?
Those are questions that I want to reply with my research.
